- ### 190529 : Self-Diagnostic Application For Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
  Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome tend to transmit wrist electromyography signals more later than the general population.<br>
  Using this, an Arduino device and a mobile application capable of self-diagnosing syndrome were produced.

- ### 191210 : 3D Cardiac Modeling for Transplantation

  After investigating possible diseases in the human heart, I studied the anatomical structure of the heart while looking for treatment methods.<br>
  Later, it was discovered that the heart itself could be made and transplanted using a technology called FRESH(Freeform Reversible Embedding 
of Suspended Hydrogels). <br>
  It would have been nice if I had used this technique to make a model of the hydrogel heart, the materials were limited in using the 3D printer, I designed the 3D cardiac model with SolidWorks and made my own heart model using the 3D printer.
