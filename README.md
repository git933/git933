- ### 190529 : Self-Diagnostic Application For Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

  Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome tend to transmit wrist electromyographic signals way more later than the general population.<br>
  Using this, an Arduino device and a mobile application capable of self-diagnosing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome were produced.

- ### 191210 : 3D Cardiac Modeling for Transplantation

  After investigating possible diseases in the human heart, I studied the anatomical structure of the heart while looking for a cure for a number of cardiovascular diseases.<br>
  Later, it was discovered that the heart itself could be made and transplanted using a technology called FRESH(Freeform Reversible Embedding 
of Suspended Hydrogels). <br>
  It would have been nice if I had used this technique to make a model of the hydrogel heart, however, the materials were limited in using the 3D printer, I designed the 3D cardiac model with SolidWorks and made my own heart model using the filament of 3D printer.

- ### 191223 ~ 200515 : Development of Ultrasonic Transducers using PVDF film

  I worked as an undergraduate research student in NanoBioMedicine lab, Pukyong university.<br>
  <br>
  While working in the lab, I read several papers about ultrasonic transducers and aimed to develop a 40 MHz ultrasonic transducer using a PVDF film among many transducers.<br>
  My role was to produce each transducer parts using SolidWorks.<br>
  The following pictures are each part brass housing, sma connector, epoxy, and insulating ceramic from the left.<br>

- ### 200622 : Real-Time Speech-to-text program - *a class assistant for whom is hard of hearing*

  As the COVID-19 situation prolonged, the demand for non-face-to-face classes increased over time.<br>
  However, I thought that it can be noted that the quality of the class experienced by students can vary depending on their Internet situation and the quality of the video.<br>
  Therefore, I developed a real-time subtitle generator, that is, real-time speech to text, which can immediately output subtitles on the screen by receiving the teacher's words.<br>
  At this time, the conversion of voice input into text was using Google Cloud speech to text api, and the development language was python.<br>

- ### 210611 : Injectable gelatin-oxidized hyaluronic acid hydrogel

  The skin is a dynamic protective tissue that acts as a strong barrier to prevent invasion of various pathogens and harmful substances and also acts as a mechanical absorption.<br>
  However, the skin is constantly damaged by various reasons.<br>
  At this time, it is recommended to put a bandage on the wound to keep it moist.<br>
  But, Injectable hydrogels have a high moisture similar to the human tissue and cause minimal intrusion and pain.<br>
  Not only can mass be effectively transferred by using highly biocompatible hydrogels, but also a porous framework for cell transplantation and proliferation can be used.<br>
  Therefore, an Injectable hydrogel with these advantages was produced.<br>
  
  <center>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51781415/169978247-38c58639-ae9d-4096-a985-0be02d8e8105.png" width="300" height="350"/>
  </center>

  First, after oxidizing hyaluronic acid, it was checked whether hyaluronic acid was well oxidized, and whether cross-linking was well achieved by synthesizing hyaluronic acid-gelatin hydrogel oxide.<br>
  
  At this time, when the concentration of hyaluronic acid oxide was 30% and the concentration of gelatin was 15%, it was confirmed that the hydrogel was produced the fastest.<br>

  <center>

  </center>


  And the properties of the synthesized hydrogel were evaluated to confirm its suitability as a medical material.<br>

  Finally, I manufactured the static mixer in SolidWorks and then printed it in 3D to see if the injectable hydrogel mixes well.<br>

- ### 210616 : Development of Artificial Intelligence for Early Detection of Arrhythmia

  The plan for arrhythmia detecting AI development was to analyze the cycle of the QRS wave of the electrocardiogram(ECG) and calculate the matching rate(%) and judge it as arrhythmia when the matching rate appears below a certain probability.<br>
  The MIT-BIHarrhythmia database and PTB HeartBeat Classification database were used to learn and test AI.<br>
  Google collab was used to write code, and the development language was Python.<br>
  At this time, both the LSTM and CNN models were applied.<br>
  The model accuracy was improved by changing the epoch, batch size, and hyperparameter several times, and significant results were obtained.<br>
