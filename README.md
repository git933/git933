# Projects

- ### 190529 : Self-Diagnostic Application For Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
  Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome tend to transmit wrist electromyography signals more later than the general population. 
  Using this, an Arduino device and a mobile application capable of self-diagnosing syndrome were produced.
