- ### 190529 : Self-Diagnostic Application For Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

  Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome tend to transmit wrist electromyographic signals way more later than the general population.<br>
  Using this, an Arduino device and a mobile application capable of self-diagnosing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome were produced.

- ### 191014 : Study and presentation of Anterior Cruciate Ligament(ACL) Rupture through dissection of pig knee joint

  The location and function of the Cruciate Ligament were confirmed through the dissection of the pig knee joint.<br>
  Furthermore, the symptoms and clinical diagnosis methods of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament rupture were investigated.<br>

- ### 191210 : 3D Cardiac Modeling for Transplantation

  After investigating possible diseases in the human heart, I studied the anatomical structure of the heart while looking for a cure for a number of cardiovascular diseases.<br>
  Later, it was discovered that the heart itself could be made and transplanted using a technology called FRESH(Freeform Reversible Embedding 
of Suspended Hydrogels). <br>
  It would have been nice if I had used this technique to make a model of the hydrogel heart, however, the materials were limited in using the 3D printer, I designed the 3D cardiac model with SolidWorks and made my own heart model using the filament of 3D printer.

- ### 191223 ~ 200515 : Development of Ultrasonic Transducers using PVDF film

  I worked as an undergraduate research student in NanoBioMedicine lab, Pukyong university.<br>
  <br>
  While working in the lab, I read several papers about ultrasonic transducers and aimed to develop a 40 MHz ultrasonic transducer using a PVDF film among many transducers.<br>
  My role was to produce each transducer parts using SolidWorks.<br>
  The following pictures are each part brass housing, sma connector, epoxy, and insulating ceramic from the left.<br>
